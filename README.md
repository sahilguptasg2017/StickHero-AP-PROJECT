Ensure that your system has Maven dependency for JUnit. Follow these steps:

    Run the StickHeroApplication file to start the game.
    Follow the in-game controls to play and enjoy.

## OOP Concepts Used

    Inheritance:
        Utilized in the GameoverController and StickHeroController classes.

    Polymorphism:
        Overriding the object class and thread methods.
        Implementation of interfaces, showcasing polymorphic variables.

## Implementation Highlights

    Game Features:
        Control the stick hero, moving between platforms.
        Multiple pillars of different widths for added challenge.
        Reviving feature with cherry count deduction for revival.
        Ensure the stick length lands on the next platform to prevent falling.
