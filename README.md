Welcome to the StickHero game repository! This project is a collaborative effort by Sahil Gupta and Vashu, showcasing their skills in Java programming and object-oriented design. The game is an implementation of the popular Stick Hero game, allowing players to control a stickman hero, move between platforms, and collect cherries to score points.

## Controls

    Mouse Click: Press and hold the mouse click to increase the length of the stick continuously.
    Spacebar: Use the spacebar to flip the stickman and collect cherries.

## How to Run the Program

Ensure that your system has Maven dependency for JUnit. Follow these steps:

    Run the StickHeroApplication file to start the game.
    Follow the in-game controls to play and enjoy.

## OOP Concepts Used

    Inheritance:
        Utilized in the GameoverController and StickHeroController classes.

    Polymorphism:
        Overriding the object class and thread methods.
        Implementation of interfaces, showcasing polymorphic variables.

## Implementation Highlights

    Game Features:
        Control the stick hero, moving between platforms.
        Multiple pillars of different widths for added challenge.
        Reviving feature with cherry count deduction for revival.
        Ensure the stick length lands on the next platform to prevent falling.

    Scoring System:
        Display last score, highest score, and total cherries collected.
        Animations and sound effects enhance the gaming experience.

    Design Patterns:
        Singleton Design Pattern: Implemented in the Hero class, ensuring only one instance of the hero in the game.
        Composite Design Pattern: Utilized for composing objects in a tree-like structure.

## JUnit Testing

Thorough JUnit testing has been performed with three tests, ensuring the robustness of the game.
## Bonus Application of threads

Multithreading has been incorporated for moving the hero and the towers, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
## How to Run JUnit Tests

Execute the JUnit tests to validate the functionality and correctness of the game.
